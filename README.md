## Description

This is a collection of hundreds of original snippets, i.e. small pieces of
code I have written to test a specific aspect of a programming language, a
programming library, a description format, a protocol, ...

Here you will find snippets for several topics:

* [programming languages](#sec_lang);
* [unix programming](#sec_unix);
* [scientific programming libraries](#sec_sci);
* [parallel computing and high performance computing programming libraries](#sec_hpc);
* [image processing programming libraries](#sec_img);
* [general API like Boost (C++)](#sec_api);
* [programming tools like Gnu Make, CMake and Apache Ant](#sec_tools);
* [XML and web development technologies](#sec_web);
* [Embedded systems programming](#sec_embedded);
* [graphical User Interface libraries](#sec_gui);
* [2D, 3D and Multimedia libraries](#sec_2d3d);
* [many others topics like design patterns, LaTeX language, Computer-aided design with OpenSCAD, ...](#sec_others)
