# PyTest

Functions to be tested are defined in `foo.py` (these functions have no particular interest and they are just a support to test PyTest).

Unit tests are defined in the `test_*.py` modules.
Unit tests defined there highlight tips and tricks specific to the object to be tested: how to assert a float variable, how to assert a sequence, etc.


## Install PyTest

In a terminal:

```
pip install pytest
```


## Notes

Each module (.py file) having a name starting with `test_` is a *test module*.
Each function starting with `test_` and defined in a *test module* is a *unit test*.

Tests are launched with the `pytest` command:

1. open a terminal
2. move to the root directory of your project
3. type `pytest`

PyTest automatically finds unit tests (based on the previously mentioned naming conventions),
executes them and and highlights those who have failed.

A unit test "fails" when it raises an exception.
